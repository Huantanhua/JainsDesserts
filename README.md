## General Info
We all love the Vanilla cake, but let's face it; it can get boring *really* fast. This mod aims to fix that by adding in more random desserts and pastries! Some desserts are even from foreign or international countries, adding some extra flavor to the mod.

Below is a list of all of the desserts, all of which can be found in the `Food and Drink` creative tab:

### Carrot Cake
- 3 slices
- 3 hunger bars/slice
- Speed I for 8 seconds/slice
