## General Info

What’s better than chocolate cake or ice cream? Tiramisu! (At least according to some people…)

Tiramisu is a mod that adds two variants of tiramisu - full tiramisu and bite sized tiramisu. Nothing more, nothing less.

## More Details

Full tiramisu works just like a cake - you place it down and right click the block to eat bites of the delicious tiramisu. One full tiramisu has 7 ‘bites’ in total. Bite sized tiramisu, on the other hand, works like any regular food item. If you don’t know how to craft these new food items, see the images section of this mod.

Note: This mod only works with Fabric API and not Forge.
